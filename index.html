<h2>What the school year would like like under varying conditions.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Using mathematical models, simulations of the upcoming school year were run under varying conditions. You can <a href="covidSim.html">access the simulation here and run some for yourself</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mathematical models are PROBABLY WRONG, but they are USEFUL to compare different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
