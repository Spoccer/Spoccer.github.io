<h1>CNHS Debate</h1>
<p><strong>Meetings</strong>: We will meet on Mondays afterschool in room 2309. You should plan to work or meet with others in your same event at least one other time per week to be successful. The season will last into December.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Most of the debate meets this year (2020) will be virtual! The events in debate are:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Congress</strong> - You will be in a room with 10-24 members. For each of three bills (<strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I6knHDSU5spUncmvvuesWtgSf9CtAuCf/view">chosen from this list</a></strong> and announced at least a week in advence) you will have the opportunity to speak for up to three minutes, and there will be question and answer time. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the speech is to convince the congress members to vote for or against the model legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is possible that you don't get to speak on every bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fcr2JL5I-re_eqvbaceroHq2qaRE-CZ7QnzJ-kvDv9k/edit"><strong>Public Forum</strong></a> - This is a 2v2 debate. It is a great event to start out with. <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Public Forum requires research and collaboration.&nbsp; Debaters argue either for or against the resolution and must be prepared to speak on both sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The current topic is:&nbsp;<strong><span class=" OGiC0d">Resolved: The United States federal government should enact the Medicare-For-All Act of 2019. <a href="https://debate.uvm.edu/dcpdf/PFNFL.pdf">This paper describes the event well.</a>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_lEOJA2aMMvarjONLrSECzMHx7GFA7M6Zp5L1OQHwCE/edit"><strong>Lincoln Douglas</strong></a> - This is a 1v1 debate. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a debate of values. Debaters argue over which side of a resolution is the greater good for society and must be prepared to speak on both sides. Topics change bi-monthly.&nbsp; The current topic for Sept./Oct. is:&nbsp;</span><strong><span class=" OGiC0d">Resolved: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory.</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-CV9mDpNnHzXLPDo8Xd3dOs-AcYqjkcLI_f3PzoEuUs/edit"><strong>Policy</strong></a> - This is a 2v2 debate over policy (obviously). <span style="font-weight: 400;">Teams of two debate one topic for the entire season. Policy requires extensive research and collaboration skills and alternate sides each round.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We have never tried this event as a school. The format makes each debate over 1 hour long. The topic for this year is:&nbsp;<strong><span class=" OGiC0d">Resolved: The United States federal government should enact substantial criminal justice reform in the United States in one or more of the following: forensic science, policing, sentencing.</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jC9KqAC5t8nqd0aNX7zMcqubqqT2cQh9Ux_E8OMn180/edit"><strong>World Schools</strong></a> - This is a 3v3 debate, and teams can be larger than 3 with members sitting out. We tried this for the first time last year, but because few schools try this event it got cancelled in many of the meets - so try at your own risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You'll want to <a href="https://www.ihsfa.org/info/rules">READ THE RULES</a>. </strong></p>
<p>You should watch videos of others who have competed in these events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to do a LOT of research. Be sure to keep a list of your sources (and have that list ready with you at the meets.)&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>There are meets that we could try as early as Oct 10th, although I don't think we'd be prepared that early. Meets are on Saturdays and will take up most of the day. We will discuss which meets we might attend at our first meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each participant will need to provide a judge for at least one meet. Judges can be parents and do not need experience. I will provide extra info for potential judges before our meets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say, and we'll keep adding to this list.&nbsp;</p>
